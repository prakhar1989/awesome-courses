	- System programming refers to writing code that tasks advantage of operating system support for programmers. This course is designed to introduce you to system programming. By the end of this course, you should be proficient at writing programs that take full advantage of operating system support. To be concrete, we need to fix an operating system and we need to choose a programming language for writing programs. We chose the C language running on a Linux/UNIX operating system (which implements the POSIX standard interface between the programmer and the OS).

	- Write a real-time OS microkernel in C, and application code to operate a model train set in response to real-time sensor information. The communication with the train set runs at 2400 baud so it takes about 61 milliseconds to ask all of the sensors for data about the train's possible location.  This makes it particularly challenging because a train can move about 3 centimeters in that time. One of the most challenging and time-consuming courses at the University of Waterloo.

	- Distributed systems often appear to be highly complex and intertwined networked systems. Touching one component often affects many others in surprising ways. In this course, we aim at explaining the basics of distributed systems by systematically taking different perspectives, and subsequently bringing these perspectives together by looking at often-applied organizations of distributed systems. This course closely follows the timeless classic <b>Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms</b> by some of the pioneers in the field of Distributes systems-Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten van Steen

	- This is a course on the study, design, and implementation of programming languages.
	- The course works at two simultaneous levels: first, we will use a programming language that can 	demonstrate a wide variety of programming paradigms. Second, using this language, we will learn about the mechanics behind programming languages by implementing our own language(s). The two level approach usually means that we will often see how to use a certain feature, and continue by implementing it.

	- Perl, PHP, JavaScript, VisualBasic -- they are often-requested skills for employment, but most of us do not have the time to find out what they are all about. In this course, you learn how to use scripting languages for rapid prototyping, web programming, data processing, and application extension. Besides covering traditional programming languages concepts as they apply to scripting (e.g., dynamic typing and scoping), this course looks at new concepts rarely found in traditional languages (e.g., string interpolation, hashes, and polylingual code). Through a series of small projects, you use different languages to achieve programming tasks that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of scripting. As a side effect, you practice teaching yourself new languages.

	- Types and Semantics is about designing and understand programming languages, whether they be domain specific or general purpose. The goal of this class is to provide a variety of tools for designing custom (programming) languages for whatever task is at hand. Part of that will be a variety of insights on how languages work along with experiences from working with academics and industry on creating new languages such as Ceylon and Kotlin. The class focuses on types and semantics and the interplay between them. This means category theory and constructive type theory (e.g. Coq and richer variations) are ancillary topics of the class. The class also covers unconventional semantic domains such as classical linear type theory in order to both break students from convential thinking and to provide powerful targets capable of formalizing thinks like networking protocols, resource-sensitive computation, and concurrency constructs. The class project is to design and formalize a (programming) language for a purpose of the student's choosing, and assignments are designed to ensure students have had a chance to practice applying the techniques learned in class before culminating these skills in the class project.

	- Teaches understanding of how a modern compiler is structured and the major algorithms that are used to translate code from high-level to machine language. The best way to do this is to actually build a working compiler, so there will be a significant project to implement one that translates programs written in a core subset of Java into executable x86 assembly language. The compilers themselves will use scanner and parser generator tools and the default implementation language is Java.

*CUNY Hunter College*
	- It is currently an intensive introduction to program development and problem solving. Its emphasis is on the process of designing, implementing, and evaluating small-scale programs. It is not supposed to be a C++ programming course, although much of the course is spent on the details of C++. C++ is an extremely large and complex programming language with many features that interact in unexpected ways. One does not need to know even half of the language to use it well.

	-  This graduate course gives a broad introduction to complexity theory, including classical results and recent developments. Complexity theory aims to understand the power of efficient computation (when computational resources like time and space are limited). Many compelling conceptual questions arise in this context. Most of these questions are (surprisingly?) difficult and far from being resolved. Nevertheless, a lot of progress has been made toward understanding them (and also why they are difficult). We will learn about these advances in this course. A theme will be combinatorial constructions with random-like properties, e.g., expander graphs and error-correcting codes. Some examples:
		-  Is finding a solution inherently more difficult than verifying it?
		-  Do more computational resources mean more computing power?
		-  Is it easier to find approximate solutions than exact ones?
		-  Are randomized algorithms more powerful than deterministic ones?
		-  Is it easier to solve problems in the average case than in the worst case?
		-  Are quantum computers more powerful than classical ones?

	- In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular 	programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.

	- This book (and course) takes a unique approach to “Intro CS.” In a nutshell, our objective is to provide an introduction to computer science as an intellectually rich and vibrant field rather than focusing exclusively on computer programming. While programming is certainly an important and pervasive element of our approach, we emphasize concepts and problem-solving over syntax and programming language features.

	- Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine learning models powering NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this spring quarter course students will learn to implement, train, debug, visualize and invent their own neural network models. The course provides a deep excursion into cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP.

	- The Web continues to grow in popularity as platform for retail transactions, financial services, and rapidly evolving forms of communication. It is becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers who wish to compromise users' systems or steal data from other sites. Browser vendors must stay ahead of these attacks by providing features that support secure web applications. This course will study vulnerabilities in existing web browsers and the applications they render, as well as new technologies that enable web applications that were never before possible. The material will be largely based on current research problems, and students will be expected to criticize and improve existing defenses. Topics of study include (but are not limited to) browser encryption, JavaScript security, plug-in security, sandboxing, web mashups, and authentication.

	- The course will cover a variety of contemporary network protocols and other systems with security properties. The course goal is to give students hands-on experience in using automated tools and related techniques to analyze and evaluate security mechanisms. To understand security properties and requirements, we will look at several network protocols and their properties, including secrecy, authentication, key establishment, and fairness. In parallel, the course will look at several models and tools used in security analysis and examine their advantages and limitations. In addition to fully automated finite-state model checking techniques, we will also study other approaches, such as constraint solving, process algebras, protocol logics, probabilistic model checking, game theory, and executable models based on logic programming.

	-  Hardware that exploits quantum phenomena can dramatically alter the nature of computation. Though constructing a working quantum computer is a formidable technological challenge, there has been much recent experimental progress. In addition, the theory of quantum computation is of interest in itself, offering strikingly different perspectives on the nature of computation and information, as well as providing novel insights into the conceptual puzzles posed by the quantum theory. The course is intended both for physicists, unfamiliar with computational complexity theory or cryptography, and also for computer scientists and mathematicians, unfamiliar with quantum mechanics. The prerequisites are familiarity (and comfort) with finite dimensional vector spaces over the complex numbers, some standard group theory, and ability to count in binary.

	- CS5540 is a masters-level course that covers a wide range of clinical problems and their associated computational challenges. The practice of medicine is filled with digitally accessible information about patients, ranging from EKG readings to MRI images to electronic health records. This poses a huge opportunity for computer tools that make sense out of this data. Computation tools can be used to answer seemingly straightforward questions about a single patient's test results (“Does this patient have a normal heart rhythm?”), or to address vital questions about large populations (“Is there any clinical condition that affects the risks of Alzheimer”). In CS5540 we will look at many of the most important sources of clinical data and discuss the basic computational techniques used for their analysis, ranging in sophistication from current clinical practice to state-of-the-art research projects.

	- This course will cover advanced topics in evolutionary algorithms and their application to open-ended computational design. The field of evolutionary computation tries to address large-scale optimization and planning problems through stochastic population-based methods. It draws inspiration from evolutionary processes in nature and in engineering, and also serves as abstract models for these phenomena. Evolutionary processes are generally weak methods that require little information about the problem domain and hence can be applied across a wide variety of applications. They are especially useful for open-ended problem domains for which little formal knowledge exists and the number of parameters is undefined, such as for the general engineering design process. This course will provide insight to a variety of evolutionary computation paradigms, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and evolutionary strategies, as well as governing dynamics of co-evolution, arms races and mediocre stable states. New methods involving symbiosis models and pattern recognition will also be presented. The material will be intertwined with discussions of representations and results for design problems in a variety of problem domains including software, electronics, and mechanics.

	- CS6452 focuses on datacenter networks and services. The emerging demand for web services and cloud computing have created need for large scale data centers. The hardware and software infrastructure for datacenters critically determines the functionality, performance, cost and failure tolerance of applications running on that datacenter. This course will examine design alternatives for both the hardware (networking) infrastructure, and the software infrastructure for datacenters.

	- This is an introductory course on Networking for graduate students. It follows a top-down approach to teaching Computer Networks, so it starts with the Application layer which most of the students are familiar with and as the course unravels we learn more about transport, network and link layers of the protocol stack.
	- As far as prerequisites are concerned - basic computer, programming and probability theory background is required.
	- The course site contains links to the lecture videos, reading material and assignments.

    - This is an undergraduate level course covering the fundamental concepts of networking as embodied in the Internet. The course will cover a wide range of topics; see the lecture schedule for more details. While the class has a textbook, we will not follow its order of presentation but will instead use the text as a reference when covering each individual topic. The course will also have several projects that involve programming (in Python). 
    - You should know programming, data structures, and software engineering. In terms of mathematics, your algebra should be very solid, you need to know basic probability, and you should be comfortable with thinking abstractly. The TAs will spend very little time reviewing material that is not specific to networking. We assume that you either know the material covered in those courses, or are willing to learn the material as necessary. We won't cover any of this material in lecture.
