This makes it particularly challenging because a train can move about 3 centimeters in that time. One of the most challenging and time-consuming courses at the University of Waterloo.

  - Teaches big-picture computing concepts using the Scheme programming language. Students will implement programs in a variety of different programming paradigms (functional, object-oriented, logical). Heavy emphasis on function composition, code-as-data, control abstraction with continuations, and syntactic abstraction through macros. An excellent course if you are looking to build a mental framework on which to hang your programming knowledge.

### Contributing
Have a few courses in mind that you think are awesome and would fit in this list? Feel free to send a [pull request](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses/pulls). However, do note that I'm not keen on adding popular courses (such as MOOCs / MIT OCW) as there are services like [ClassCentral](https://www.class-central.com/) doing a great job of aggregation. This list is ideally for courses which are relatively unknown and make their material (assignments, lectures, exams etc.) available online for free.
