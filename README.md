### Systems

- [CS 107](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/index.html) **Computer Organization & Systems** *Stanford University* <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f9.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Videos" />
<img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Assignments" />
	- CS107 is the third course in Stanford's introductory programming sequence. The course will work from the C programming language down to the microprocessor to de-mystify the machine. With a complete understanding of how computer systems execute programs and manipulate data, you will become a more effective programmer, especially in dealing with issues of debugging, performance, portability, and robustness.

	- This class introduces the basic facilities provided in modern operating systems. The course divides into three major sections. The first part of the course discusses concurrency. The second part of the course addresses the problem of memory management. The third major part of the course concerns file systems.

	- In the project assignments in CS186, you will write a basic database management system called SimpleDB. For this project, you will focus on implementing the core modules required to access stored data on disk; in future projects, you will add support for various query processing operators, as well as transactions, locking, and concurrent queries.

	- System programming refers to writing code that tasks advantage of operating system support for programmers. This course is designed to introduce you to system programming. By the end of this course, you should be proficient at writing programs that take full advantage of operating system support. To be concrete, we need to fix an operating system and we need to choose a programming language for writing programs. We chose the C language running on a Linux/UNIX operating system (which implements the POSIX standard interface between the programmer and the OS).

	- Write a real-time OS microkernel in C, and application code to operate a model train set in response to real-time sensor information. The communication with the train set runs at 2400 baud so it takes about 61 milliseconds to ask all of the sensors for data about the train's possible location.  This makes it particularly challenging because a train can move about 3 centimeters in that time. One of the most challenging and time-consuming courses at the University of Waterloo.

*CUNY Hunter College* 
	- It is currently an intensive introduction to program development and problem solving. Its emphasis is on the process of designing, implementing, and evaluating small-scale programs. It is not supposed to be a C++ programming course, although much of the course is spent on the details of C++. C++ is an extremely large and complex programming language with many features that interact in unexpected ways. One does not need to know even half of the language to use it well.

### Contributing

Have a few courses in mind that you think are awesome and would fit in this list? Feel free to send a [pull request](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses/pulls). However, do note that I'm not keen on adding popular courses (such as MOOCs / MIT OCW) as there are services like [ClassCentral](https://www.class-central.com/) doing a great job of aggregation. This list is ideally for courses which are relatively unknown and make their material (assignments, lectures, exams etc.) available online for free.
