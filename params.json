To complement the theoretical aspect, several state of the art tools will be introduced. New and emerging topics in hybrid systems research will be presented as well. As the field of hybrid systems is a truly interdisciplinary one, drawing researchers from dynamical systems, control theory, computer aided verification, automata theory and other fields, one of the goals of this course is to teach students the language that will allow them to bridge the gap between these traditionally disjoint disciplines.\r\n\t- [Lectures](http://verifiablerobotics.com/courses/mae6740.html)\r\n\t- [Readings](http://verifiablerobotics.com/courses/mae6740.html)\r\n- [PODC](http://dcg.ethz.ch/lectures/podc_allstars/) **Principles of Distributed Computing** *ETH-Zurich* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Assignments\" title=\"Assignments\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4da.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Readings\" title=\"Readings\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Notes\" title=\"Lecture Notes\" />\r\n\t- Explore essential algorithmic ideas and lower bound techniques, basically the \"pearls\" of distributed computing in an easy-to-read set of lecture notes, combined with complete exercises and solutions.\r\n\t- [Book](http://dcg.ethz.ch/lectures/podc_allstars/lecture/podc.pdf)\r\n\t- [Assignments and Solutions](http://dcg.ethz.ch/lectures/podc_allstars/)\r\n- [SPAC](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djg/teachingMaterials/spac/) **Parallelism and Concurrency** *Univ of Washington* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4da.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Readings\" title=\"Readings\" />\r\n\t- Technically not a course nevertheless an awesome collection of materials used by Prof Dan Grossman to teach parallelism and concurrency concepts to sophomores at UWash\r\n- [VU:Distributed Systems](http://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php?id=distributed-systems-principles-and-paradigms) **Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms (Fall 2012)** *Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f9.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Videos\" title=\"Lecture Videos\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Assignments\" title=\"Assignments\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Notes\" title=\"Lecture Notes\" />\r\n\t- Distributed systems often appear to be highly complex and intertwined networked systems. Touching one component often affects many others in surprising ways. In this course, we aim at explaining the basics of distributed systems by systematically taking different perspectives, and subsequently bringing these perspectives together by looking at often-applied organizations of distributed systems. This course closely follows the timeless classic <b>Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms</b> by some of the pioneers in the field of Distributes systems-Andrew S.

In this course, you learn how to use scripting languages for rapid prototyping, web programming, data processing, and application extension. Besides covering traditional programming languages concepts as they apply to scripting (e.g., dynamic typing and scoping), this course looks at new concepts rarely found in traditional languages (e.g., string interpolation, hashes, and polylingual code). Through a series of small projects, you use different languages to achieve programming tasks that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of scripting.

The goal of this class is to provide a variety of tools for designing custom (programming) languages for whatever task is at hand. Part of that will be a variety of insights on how languages work along with experiences from working with academics and industry on creating new languages such as Ceylon and Kotlin. The class focuses on types and semantics and the interplay between them. This means category theory and constructive type theory (e.g. Coq and richer variations) are ancillary topics of the class. The class also covers unconventional semantic domains such as classical linear type theory in order to both break students from convential thinking and to provide powerful targets capable of formalizing thinks like networking protocols, resource-sensitive computation, and concurrency constructs. The class project is to design and formalize a (programming) language for a purpose of the student's choosing, and assignments are designed to ensure students have had a chance to practice applying the techniques learned in class before culminating these skills in the class project.\r\n\t- [Syllabus](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS6118/2012fa/)\r\n\t- [Lectures](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS6118/2012fa/)\r\n- [CSC 253](http://pgbovine.net/cpython-internals.htm) **CPython internals: A ten-hour codewalk through the Python interpreter source code** *University of Rochester* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f9.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Videos\" title=\"Lecture Videos\" /><img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4da.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Readings\" title=\"Readings\" />\r\n  - Nine lectures walking through the internals of CPython, the canonical Python interpreter implemented in C.

Emphasis is placed on fundamental algorithms and advanced methods of algorithmic design, analysis, and implementation. Techniques to be covered include amortization, randomization, fingerprinting, word-level parallelism, bit scaling, dynamic programming, network flow, linear programming, fixed-parameter algorithms, and approximation algorithms. Domains include string algorithms, network optimization, parallel algorithms, computational geometry, online algorithms, external memory, cache, and streaming algorithms, and data structures. The need for efficient algorithms arises in nearly every area of computer science. But the type of problem to be solved, the notion of what algorithms are \"efficient,'' and even the model of computation can vary widely from area to area. In this second class in algorithms, we will survey many of the techniques that apply broadly in the design of efficient algorithms, and study their application in a wide range of application domains and computational models. The goal is for the class to be broad rather than deep. Our plan is to touch upon the following areas. This is a tentative list of topics that might be covered in the class; we will select material adaptively based on the background, interests, and rate of progress of the students.\r\n\t- [Lecture Videos - Spring 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6ogFv-ieghdoGKGg2Bik3Gl1glBTEu8c)\r\n\t- [Lecture Notes](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-854j-advanced-algorithms-fall-2005/lecture-notes/)\r\n \t- [Assignments](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-854j-advanced-algorithms-fall-2005/assignments/)\r\n\t- [Readings](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-854j-advanced-algorithms-fall-2005/readings/)\r\n\t- [Resources](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-854j-advanced-algorithms-fall-2005/download-course-materials/)\r\n- [15-451/651](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-f10/www/) **Algorithms** *Carnegie Mellon University* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Notes\" title=\"Lecture Notes\" />\r\n\t- The required algorithms class that go in depth into all basic algorithms and the proofs behind them.

Complexity theory aims to understand the power of efficient computation (when computational resources like time and space are limited). Many compelling conceptual questions arise in this context. Most of these questions are (surprisingly?) difficult and far from being resolved. Nevertheless, a lot of progress has been made toward understanding them (and also why they are difficult). We will learn about these advances in this course. A theme will be combinatorial constructions with random-like properties, e.g., expander graphs and error-correcting codes. Some examples:\r\n\t\t-  Is finding a solution inherently more difficult than verifying it?\r\n\t\t-  Do more computational resources mean more computing power?\r\n\t\t-  Is it easier to find approximate solutions than exact ones?\r\n\t\t-  Are randomized algorithms more powerful than deterministic ones?\r\n\t\t-  Is it easier to solve problems in the average case than in the worst case?\r\n\t\t-  Are quantum computers more powerful than classical ones?\r\n\t- [Syllabus](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~dsteurer/complexity12/)\r\n\t- [Lectures](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~dsteurer/complexity12/#lectures)\r\n\t- [Assignments](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~dsteurer/complexity12/#homework)\r\n- [CSCE 3193](http://www.csce.uark.edu/~sgauch/3193/S11/index.html) **Programming Paradigms** *University of Arkansas (Fayetteville)*\t<img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Assignments\" title=\"Assignments\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Notes\" title=\"Lecture Notes\" />\r\n\t- Programming in different paradigms with emphasis on object oriented programming, network programming and functional programming.

Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine learning models powering NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this spring quarter course students will learn to implement, train, debug, visualize and invent their own neural network models. The course provides a deep excursion into cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP.\r\n\t- [Syllabus](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)\r\n\t- [Lectures and Assignments](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)\r\n- [CS 229r](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~minilek/cs229r/fall15/index.html) **Algorithms for Big Data** *Harvard University* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f9.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Videos\" title=\"Lecture Videos\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Assignments\" title=\"Assignments\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Notes\" title=\"Lecture Notes\" />\r\n\t- Big data is data so large that it does not fit in the main memory of a single machine, and the need to process big data by efficient algorithms arises in Internet search, network traffic monitoring, machine learning, scientific computing, signal processing, and several other areas.

It is becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers who wish to compromise users' systems or steal data from other sites. Browser vendors must stay ahead of these attacks by providing features that support secure web applications. This course will study vulnerabilities in existing web browsers and the applications they render, as well as new technologies that enable web applications that were never before possible. The material will be largely based on current research problems, and students will be expected to criticize and improve existing defenses. Topics of study include (but are not limited to) browser encryption, JavaScript security, plug-in security, sandboxing, web mashups, and authentication.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n### Artificial Intelligence\r\n\r\n- [CS 188](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html) **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** *UC Berkeley* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f9.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Videos\" title=\"Lecture Videos\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Assignments\" title=\"Assignments\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png\" width=\"20    \" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Notes\" title=\"Lecture Notes\" />\r\n    - This course will introduce the basic ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems.

Though constructing a working quantum computer is a formidable technological challenge, there has been much recent experimental progress. In addition, the theory of quantum computation is of interest in itself, offering strikingly different perspectives on the nature of computation and information, as well as providing novel insights into the conceptual puzzles posed by the quantum theory. The course is intended both for physicists, unfamiliar with computational complexity theory or cryptography, and also for computer scientists and mathematicians, unfamiliar with quantum mechanics. The prerequisites are familiarity (and comfort) with finite dimensional vector spaces over the complex numbers, some standard group theory, and ability to count in binary.\r\n\t- [Syllabus](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/P4481-P7681-CS4812/Fa12.html)\r\n\t- [Lectures](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/physics4481-7681_2014sp/)\r\n- [CS 4860](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS4860/2012fa/) **Applied Logic** *Cornell University* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Assignments\" title=\"Assignments\" /> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Notes\" title=\"Lecture Notes\" />\r\n\t- In addition to basic first-order logic, when taught by Computer Science this course involves elements of Formal Methods and Automated Reasoning.

The practice of medicine is filled with digitally accessible information about patients, ranging from EKG readings to MRI images to electronic health records. This poses a huge opportunity for computer tools that make sense out of this data. Computation tools can be used to answer seemingly straightforward questions about a single patient's test results (“Does this patient have a normal heart rhythm?”), or to address vital questions about large populations (“Is there any clinical condition that affects the risks of Alzheimer”). In CS5540 we will look at many of the most important sources of clinical data and discuss the basic computational techniques used for their analysis, ranging in sophistication from current clinical practice to state-of-the-art research projects.\r\n\t- [Syllabus](https://sites.google.com/site/cs5540sp2013/home/course-description)\r\n\t- [Lectures](https://sites.google.com/site/cs5540sp2013/lectures)\r\n\t- [Assignments](https://sites.google.com/site/cs5540sp2013/assignments)\r\n- [CS 5724](http://courses2.cit.cornell.edu/cs5724/) **Evolutionary Computation** *Cornell University* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Assignments\" title=\"Assignments\"/> <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Notes\" title=\"Lecture Notes\" />\r\n\t- This course will cover advanced topics in evolutionary algorithms and their application to open-ended computational design. The field of evolutionary computation tries to address large-scale optimization and planning problems through stochastic population-based methods. It draws inspiration from evolutionary processes in nature and in engineering, and also serves as abstract models for these phenomena. Evolutionary processes are generally weak methods that require little information about the problem domain and hence can be applied across a wide variety of applications. They are especially useful for open-ended problem domains for which little formal knowledge exists and the number of parameters is undefined, such as for the general engineering design process. This course will provide insight to a variety of evolutionary computation paradigms, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and evolutionary strategies, as well as governing dynamics of co-evolution, arms races and mediocre stable states. New methods involving symbiosis models and pattern recognition will also be presented. The material will be intertwined with discussions of representations and results for design problems in a variety of problem domains including software, electronics, and mechanics.\r\n\t- [Syllabus](http://courses2.cit.cornell.edu/cs5724/)\r\n\t- [Lectures](http://courses2.cit.cornell.edu/cs5724/schedule.htm)\r\n\t- [Assignments](http://courses2.cit.cornell.edu/cs5724/)\r\n- [CS 6452](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS6452/2012sp/index.php) **Evolutionary Computation** *Cornell University* <img src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\"Lecture Notes\" title=\"Lecture Notes\" />\r\n\t- CS6452 focuses on datacenter networks and services.
